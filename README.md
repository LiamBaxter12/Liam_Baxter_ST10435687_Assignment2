My Pet Bob
This is a detailed step-by-step instruction manual on how to install and operate my application.
******************************************************************************************
Step 1: Open Android Studio.
Step 2: Run the application.
Step 3: Press the button labelled 'Play Now'.
Step 4: Once the screen changes to the game screen, press either of the three buttons labelled 'feed', 'play' or 'clean'.
Step 5: If either button is pressed, an image corresponding to the button pressed will appear, and the progress bar for said action will also increase or fill up.
Step 6: The progress bar decreases every minute so that you can continually care for your pet.
Step 7: Close the application if you have finished using it.
